# texteditor

Text editor i am making using java and swing.

### Goals:
-[] Save properly
-[] Refactor(comparing strings for the menus is not a good idea)

### Requirements:
- Maven
- Java 21(although there is nothing that prevents this from running in an older version probably)

### To run:
```
mvn project
java -cp target/text-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.john.text.editor
```
